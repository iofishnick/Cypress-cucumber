Installing Cypress 12.6.0
Cypress is a popular end-to-end testing framework that helps developers test their web applications efficiently. This guide will provide instructions on how to install Cypress version 12.6.0.

Prerequisites
Before installing Cypress, make sure the following software is installed on your system: 
- Node.js (version 10 or above) 
- npm (version 5 or above) 

Installation Steps 
1. Open your terminal and create a new directory for your project by typing the following command: 
    `mkdir my-cypress-project` 
2. Change into the newly created directory: 
    `cd my-cypress-project` 
3. Initialize a new npm project by running: 
    `npm init -y` 
4. Install Cypress 12.6.0 by running the following command:  
    `npm install cypress@12.6.0 --save-dev`  
This command installs Cypress as a dev dependency in your project and saves it to your package.json file.  

5. Once the installation is complete, open Cypress by running:  
    `npx cypress open`  
This will launch the Cypress Test Runner, where you can write and run tests for your application.  

6. Next, install the Cucumber preprocessor:
    `npm install @badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor`
7. Change the cypress.config.js file as recommended in the following installation guide:

8. Run the following command install the plugin and correct the exception showing in cypress.config.ts file:
    `npm install --save-dev @bahmutov/cypress-esbuild-preprocessor`
9. In order for Cypress to be able to "see" .ts files run the following command:
    `npm install --save-dev @bahmutov/cypress-esbuild-preprocessor`
10. Enable the Cucumber (Gherkin) Full Support vs code extension
11. Go to File-->Preferences-->Settings select the Extensions dropdown, select the cucumber extension and open the settings.json
12. Add the following line of code, to settings.json file, in order to set the location of the step definition files `"cucumberautocomplete.steps": ["cypress/support/step_definitions/*.js"]`
13. Add the following lines in the end of the package.json file
    `"cypress-cucumber-preprocessor": {"stepDefinitions": "cypress/support/step_definitions/**/*.js"}`

Conclusion  
You have successfully installed Cypress 12.6.0 on your system! Happy testing!
